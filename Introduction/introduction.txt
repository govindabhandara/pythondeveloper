Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was initially
designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It
was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers
to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more
efficiently.

The following are the primary factors to use python in day-to-day life:
1. Python is object-oriented
	Structure supports such concepts as polymorphism, operation overloading and
	multiple inheritance.
2. Indentation
	Indentation is one of the greatest feature in python
3. It’s free (open source)
	Downloading python and installing python is free and easy
4. It’s Powerful
	. Dynamic typing
	. Built-in types and tools
	. Library utilities
	. Third party utilities (e.g. Numeric, NumPy, sciPy)
	. Automatic memory management
5. It’s Portable
	. Python runs virtually every major platform used today
	. As long as you have a compaitable python interpreter installed, python
programs will run in exactly the same manner, irrespective of platform.
6. It’s easy to use and learn
	. No intermediate compile
	. Python Programs are compiled automatically to an intermediate form called
	  byte code, which the interpreter then reads.
	. This gives python the development speed of an interpreter without the
performance loss inherent in purely interpreted languages.
	. Structure and syntax are pretty intuitive and easy to grasp.
7. Interpreted Language
	. Python is processed at runtime by python Interpreter
8. Interactive Programming Language
	. Users can interact with the python interpreter directly for writing the programs
9. Straight forward syntax
	. The formation of python syntax is simple and straight forward which also makes it
	  popular.
