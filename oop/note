python is general purpose programming :
    1) scripting programming
    2) Function
    3) Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP: We can create object by using class.
    eg. class Account:
            pass
            to maintain dummy block
        a1=Account()
        id(a1)
        id(a2)

Class : Class is a template, design, plan, draft, data type (blue print), to construct objects.
        It uses to construct object.
        class Contain variable and methods.
        class Account:
            variables and methods
            to maintain dummy block
        a1=Account()
        id(a1)
        id(a2)
        We use the class name with always capital letter.
        when once object is created then memory loc allocated.
        variables and methods
        
variables: 
        1) local variable
        2) class variable/static 
        3) instance variable

method: 
        1) instance method
        2) class method
        3) static method || construct method

self: self is a keyword/pointing to current object ,
      Inside class to access class members.
